What do you think makes a successful AirBnB rental in this market? 

    After analyzing the data in "final_airbnb", it seems to me that there is no exact science to this business. The "number_of_reviews" suggests that Manhattan locations are the most popular with an average of about 136 reviews per listing. The "number_of_reviews" also suggests that Brooklyn isn't too far behind with an average of about 106 reviews per listing.

What factors seem to be at play the most?

    The factors that seem to be at play the most are the three columns labeled "neighbourhood_group", "number_of_reviews" and "reviews_per_month". The other columns, on the other hand, can only serve to give misleading information when it comes to chosing the best airbnb for your travels.
